# Introduction

YuukaTalk is a brand-new momotalk editor app for Android aiming to provide more comfortable experience for re-creation authors.

We already have amazing works such as **YuzuTalk**, **ClosureTalk**, **MolluTalk**, and **MoeTalk**. However, each of above-mentioned editors either has been taken down or not supports mobile phone well, which is the inspiration this app is given.

Why named YuukaTalk? I love Yuuka.
